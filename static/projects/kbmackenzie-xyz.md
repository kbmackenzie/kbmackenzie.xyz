This website! Written in TypeScript, React, Sass and Next.js. All animations are hand-written. It's my personal website, and doubles as blog.

Blog posts are compiled with [kestrel](https://github.com/kbmackenzie/kestrel), a little blog compiler I wrote! 

This website is entirely open-source. To see the Github repository, click the button below!
