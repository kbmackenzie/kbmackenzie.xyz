This website! Written entirely from scratch in TypeScript with React, Sass and Next.js.

All animations are written by hand! No templates used! 🐱💖

This website is entirely open-source! The source code is available [on its Github repository][1]! Additionally,
blog posts are organized with [Alpaca][2], a little blog utility I wrote!
