I have made a lot of mods for the game "[Cult of the Lamb][1]"! I'm one of the core contributors to the [COTL modding API][2] and the [COTL JSONLoader modding tool][3].

Additionally, I have worked on:

- [Weapon Selector][4]: A mod that lets you choose what weapons and curses you get in dungeons. It adds a little weapon selection UI at the pause screen.
- [Red Hearts First][5]: A mod that lets you choose the order in which hearts are consumed. It adds a little menu at the pause screen for choosing the heart order.
- [Possum Follower][6]: A mod that adds an Opossum follower to the game. This mod was created *before* opossums were added as a follower option in the base game.
