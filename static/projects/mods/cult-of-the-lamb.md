I'm one of the core contributors to the [Cult of the Lamb Modding API][1] and the [COTL JSON-loader modding tool][2].

Additionally, I have made a few Cult of the Lamb mods:

- [Weapon Selector][3]: A mod that lets you choose what weapons and curses you get in dungeons. It adds a little weapon selection UI at the pause screen.
- [Red Hearts First][4]: A mod that lets you choose the order in which hearts are consumed. It adds a little menu at the pause screen for choosing the heart order.
- [Possum Follower][5]: A mod that adds an Opossum follower to the game. This mod was created *before* opossums were added as a follower option in the base game.
