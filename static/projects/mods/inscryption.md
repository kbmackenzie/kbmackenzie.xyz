I'm one of the core contributors to the [Inscryption Modding API][1] and [the Inscryption JSON-loader modding tool][2].

Additionally, I have made a few Inscryption mods and modding tools:

- [Spritesheet API][3]: A modding tool for loading spritesheets as animated card portraits.
- [Talking Possum][4]: A mod that adds an opossum talking card. It serves as an example of how to create talking cards using my contributions to JSONCardLoader. A full guide can be found [here][6].
- [JSON Boss Dialogue][5]: A modding tool for overriding boss dialogue in the game with JSON.
