The repository for my personal website/blog. See it in action at [kbmackenzie.xyz][1]!

Written entirely from scratch in TypeScript with React, Sass and Next.js.

All animations are written by hand! No templates used! 🐱💖 Additionally, blog posts are organized with [Alpaca][2], a little blog utility I wrote!

![A screenshot of the website, viewed in a desktop screen. It features a color palette with purple and pink tones, and a drawing of an alpaca in the upper right corner.](./preview.jpg)
