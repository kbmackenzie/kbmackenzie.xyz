The repository for my personal website/blog. See it in action at [kbmackenzie.xyz][1]!

Written entirely from scratch in TypeScript with React, Sass and Next.js.

All animations are written by hand! No templates used! 🐱💖 Additionally, log posts are organized with [Alpaca][2], a little blog utility I wrote!
