The repository for my personal website/blog. See it in action at [kbmackenzie.xyz](https://kbmackenzie.xyz)!

Written entirely from scratch in TypeScript with React, Sass and Next.js.

All animations are written by hand! No templates used! 🐱💖

Blog posts are organized with [Alpaca](https://github.com/kbmackenzie/alpaca), a little blog utility I wrote!
